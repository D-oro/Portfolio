        <h1>Three things every developer should know</h1>
        <h2>Basic accessibility skills for devs</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you're already a hot shit developer building the next
          spotify, or you only just fell out of a coding bootcamp, here are a 
          few beginner-level accessibility skills that every developer should 
          know.
        </p>
        <h3>1. How to use Firefox Accessibility Inspector</h3>
        <p>
          Did you know Firefox has integrated accessibility testing tools?
          There's no need to install any plugins or add-ons, 
          Firefox comes with an Accessibility Inspector by default. 
          Here's where to find it:
          <div class="list-image-container">
          <ul>
            <li>Go to any webpage on Firefox</li>
            <li>Right click</li>
            <li>Select "Inspect Accessibility Properties"
              <br/>(the second option from below )</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="image-text-container">
          <img src="./images/inspect_firefox.png" alt="firefox context menu" class="img-portrait">
          <p class="image-description">Firefox context menu</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
        The accessibility inspector contains a lot of useful tools, 
        including automated testing, a colour perception simulator, a visual 
        representation of the tabbing order, and the accessibility tree of the whole 
        page which can be printed to JSON. It's a great tool for a quick colour contrast check,
        and to inspect element properties in the accessibility tree. 
        </p>
        <div class="image-text-container">
          <img src="./images/firefox_menu.png" alt="firefox accessibility inspector" class="img-landscape">
          <p class="image-description">Firefox Accessibility Inspector</p>  
        </div>
        <p>
          Check out
          <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/accessibility_inspector/" class="external-link">
            <span class="arrow-down" aria-hidden="true">&rarr;&nbsp;</span>the Firefox Accessibility Inspector documentation
          </a>
          to learn more about this useful tool.

        <h3>2. How to navigate by keyboard only</h3>
        <p>
          A great website doesn't rely on a mouse for navigation.
          Ensuring good keyboard navigation can make interacting with your
          webpage faster and easier for a lot of people.
          However a lot of developers don't know the keyboard controls for
          native html elements, so let's change that!  
          Here are the most common keyboard controls: 
          <table>
            <caption><h4>Keyboard controls and their functions</h4></caption>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th scope="col">Key</th>
                <th scope="col">Functions</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row" class="key-cell"><p class="keyboard-key">tab</p></th>
                <td>go to the next interactive element</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row" class="key-cell"><p class="keyboard-key">shift</p>+<p class="keyboard-key">tab</p></th>
                <td>go to previous interactive element</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row" class="key-cell"><p class="keyboard-key"><span aria-hidden="true">&crarr;&nbsp</span>Enter</p> or <p class="keyboard-key">return</p></th>
                <td>activate links and some buttons</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row" class="key-cell"><p class="keyboard-key">spacebar</p></th>
                <td>check checkboxes</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row" class="key-cell">
                  <p class="visually-hidden">up arrow</p>
                  <p class="keyboard-key" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;&uarr;&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="visually-hidden">down arrow</p>
                  <p class="keyboard-key" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;&darr;&nbsp;</p> 
                </th>
                <td>move between radio buttons, and move between options in select drop-down menus</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row" class="key-cell"><p class="keyboard-key">esc</p></th>
                <td>close pop up menus, overlay modals, close select menus, dismiss notifications</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row" class="key-cell"><p class="keyboard-key">spacebar</p></th>
                <td>scroll down the page</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row" class="key-cell"><p class="keyboard-key">shift</p>+<p class="keyboard-key">spacebar</p></th>
                <td>scroll up the page</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p><b>Note:</b> Not every website is going to implement keyboard navigation in the same way, 
            but this is how native html elements can be interacted with, at least in theory.
            A good website to try these out are UK Government websites, for example the
            <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/" class="external-link"><span class="arrow-down" aria-hidden="true">&rarr;&nbsp;</span>GOV.UK Design Systems webpage</a>
          </p>
        </p>
        <h3>3. How to use a screen reader</h3>
        <p>
          There is a lot to know about using a screen reader, and a non-disabled developer
          using a screen reader for development purposes is of course not
          comparable to usability testing with the experts who use screen readers 
          to get around the web every day. 
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said, I think there is value in understanding
          that there are many different ways to perceive the same webpage, 
          and if you're a visual user you might easily miss a whole 
          different dimension. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So, to get a first glimpse into a different way to see the world, 
          I'd like you to open a website (ideally something you built yourself) 
          and spend a few minutes exploring it using a screen reader. 
        </p>
        <h4>
          How to turn a screen reader on and off on a computer:
        </h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Windows</b>: <p class="keyboard-key">Ctrl</p> + Windows key + Enter</b></li>
            <li><b>macOs</b>: VoiceOver <b>command + F5</b></li>
            <li>if you run Linux or another niche OS, I'm sure you love
              open source things, so go ahead and install NVDA, it's the best out of 
              those three options anyway. 
            </li>
