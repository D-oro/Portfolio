        <h1>Accessibility for developers</h1>
        <h2>Simple things to build code for a fairer world</h2>
        <h3>1. Use Firefox Dev Tools</h3>
        <p>
          Did you know Firefox Dev Tools have integrated accessibility testing tools?
          <div class="list-image-container">
          <ul>
            <li>Go to any webpage on Firefox</li>
            <li>Right click</li>
            <li>Select "Inspect Accessibility Properties"
              <br/>(the second option from below )</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="image-text-container">
          <img src="./images/inspect_firefox.png" alt="firefox context menu" class="img-portrait">
          <p class="image-description">Firefox context menu</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
        The accessibility inspector contains a lot of useful tools, 
        including automated testing, a colour perception simulator, visually showing the tabbing order, 
        and the accessibility tree of the whole page which can be printed to JSON. 
        <br/>I use the Firefox accessibility inspector most often for a quick way to check colour contrasts
        and to inspect elements in the accessibility tree. 
        </p>
